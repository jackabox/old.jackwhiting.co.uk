Every now and then you want to set up a fresh WordPress install, usually when the site is going in a different direction and a lot of their data then becomes redundant. When working with a client I had to find a way to do this and keep hold of all their media. Before I was ready to import the media I created a blank WordPress site (v4.3), the reason I used a blank site was to make sure there were no conflicts with IDs of the media I was importing.

WordPress stores all media library uploads into the database. Firstly, it creates a new post entry, this has a type of attachment. Secondly, it creates metadata attached to the post to store all the property information of the image. Knowing these two things allows us to set up a query on the SQL to grab the data.

### Getting the Posts

We will get the posts first. To do this you will need to load into your selected database management tool. I am a big fan of [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) so the following screenshots will be utilising that tool.

Run a query on the database to find all attachments...

~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM `wp_posts` where `post_type` = "attachment"
~~~

_Do not forget to update the prefix of **wp_** to whatever prefix your database uses._

If the query was executed correctly it should have returned any posts which are stored in the database as media files. For me, this was around 2800 records. Next, we need to export these.

In [Sequel Pro](http://sequelpro.com) you can go to **File > Export** or use the OSX shortcut **CMD + SHIFT + E**. You will be presented with a screen that has multiple options. We want to export **queried results** as a CSV file, this will allow for easy import into our new database.

You should now have all of your media attachments saved to your computer. We will import these later when we also have the metadata.

### Getting the Post Metadata

Getting the metadata follows the exact same method as getting the posts just using a slightly different query. For the metadata, there are multiple rows weâ€™ll need to grab. Luckily for us, they all match a similar string and we can use a LIKE lookup on the table to get the data we need.

We are looking to return to sets of data per each media file, this is the **_wp_attached_file** and the **_wp_attachment_metadata**. Between these two rows of data, it will tell our WordPress install where the media file is located and the title, width, height, etc. To get the postmeta we need to query the database, using the following command, and then export the queried results.

~~~sql
SELECT * FROM `wp_postmeta` where `meta_key` LIKE "%wp_attach%"
~~~
