_This post was originally published in 2014, it was updated in 2016._

I had previously written a blog post titled “University Isn’t Everything”, this continues the thoughts expressed in that post.

When I wrote the first post on this subject, I wanted to express my thoughts on why university didn't feel all that fulfilling or stimulating with regards to moving into the Web Design Industry. It requires a lot more then a degree to become successful and I don't think this is portrayed well within university.

Since that post, I had finished my second year with a 1st. After a four month summer break (of which I was mostly ill) I enrolled on my final year to complete my degree.

The main module of the third year is the dissertation. On my course the dissertation is worth **one third** of the final grade. It’s a great module to allow students to push themselves and pursue something they have a passion in with no restraints on what languages you can use.

I chose to build an application aimed to help people with Crohn’s Disease. It was originally going to be built using Backbone.js for the client and use Laravel to create an API to work with the server.

I’ve never used Backbone before and I’m not the best JavaScript programmer so I wanted to push myself.

### Passion

This was the way I perceive the dissertation. A chance to explore new languages and push my skills. I have also seen very much the opposite attitude to this. I have seen people cower and not be willing to push themselves due to the fear of a poorer grade or no real passion to learn or try something new. The majority of students tend to take the safe option rather then be driven by the fire so many designers and developers are in the “real world”.

I attended Industry Conference in 2013 @iamashley said something that I will always remember.

I had passion, a passion to try. Passion in my opinion is more powerful then knowledge because passion can lead to that. One person with passion is capable of being more effective then a handful of people with more experience but who don’t care enough.

If you have that wee fire in your belly, and you’ll know if you’ve got it because you can physically feel it. If you have that people will not stand in your way.

You can watch Ashley’s full talk on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/67567032).

Ashley showed the passion which is missing within most university students. The passion to really enjoy and love what you do. I’m not saying that all university students don’t have it, there are always people who do but it seems to be the few rather than the many.

It seems to me that mixture between the modules taught and the lack of enthusiasm causes a bad image for the new entries into the industry.

### Module Content

The modules taught can be relatively mundane. One module at Northumbria University only just beings to introduce HTML5 and jQuery in the final year. The previous two years of taught modules never introduced HTML5, CSS3 coverage was limited, and jQuery was frowned upon.

Things I took for granted within the first few months of teaching myself to code, were suddenly danger zones you’d lose marks for. I felt as if I had been dragged 10 steps backwards rather than pushed and excelled. When I was teaching myself I would use Google to try and find a solution to any problems I had, and learn from that solution. I was using HTML5 and jQuery before I even knew I was, but I had to not integrate any of this into University.

Don’t get me wrong. If you are a newcomer and don’t know anything about coding for the web, or are visual learners, university can be very beneficial. They get to sit down with Tutors and learn modules in a structured manner, limited to that of the module. That is just it though. It’s limited to the module, the scope is small, the tutors teach only their module usually and don’t merge with that of other modules.

Within five months of me learning to code and building confidence I had launched my first website. This was a custom WordPress theme for a lovely woman who took a chance with me because I showed passion. The website involved coding HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, PHP and integrating Google Analytics. It may not be the prettiest site but it was my first. It took five months from learning to code to launching a website covering more than that of the first two years of my degree.

Maybe this was just my University, but it just seems too limited on the scope of what you learn in the time span you are given to learn it.

### Safety Nets

The main benefit university offers is a safety net. If it hadn’t been for University I would not be where I am now.
To provide some background to that. I must have applied for around 100 jobs before turning 18 and I was never successful in getting one of them. At the time of applying this frustrated me, I didn’t feel I had any notable skills. I was given interviews but could just never land the job.

I then took a massive leap of faith and rethought the way I looked at the world. If it wasn’t going to let me get a job I would create my own. As I mentioned above the first client I managed to successfully land was Linchpin PA, I received this through the connections university provided. It gave me a huge confidence boost and something to show people. After that I managed to work with lots of amazing people and got me to where I am, but university provided me with my first client.

I would of also never been financially secure enough to do what I do now. University gave me a safety net of £5,000 a year. Providing me with a roof, money for the bills, and allowed me to buy food so I could live comfortably. With that comfort I managed build a name for myself. I know a lot of people work with clients on the side of their full-time job before freelancing but for me my full-time job felt like university.

### Closing Thoughts

I have probably mentioned several negative things about University. I don’t want it to seem like I think university is a waste of time. University is great for many things: social life, a safety net, close learning with tutors. I just feel like people would be able to do more if only they had the “fire in their belly” to learn more outside of the scope given by universities.
In once sentence I’d sum up what I’m saying as: find your passion and embrace it, push the boundaries of what you know and always try learn new things.
