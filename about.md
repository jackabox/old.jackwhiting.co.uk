<div class="lead-message"><p>
    Hello, my name is Jack Whiting.
</p></div>

I'm a 25-year-old Web Designer & Developer. Currently based in Nottingham, United Kingdom. I am <a href="mailto:hi@jackwhiting.co.uk?subject=Hi Jack" title="Contact Me for Work">available for freelance consultancy</a> on Websites & Web Applications.

I take pride in building custom solutions which solve real world problems. I build websites and applications which have a beautiful design, provide simplicity to your user and are optimised for delivery and speed. With the use of WordPress, Laravel and Shopify, I can provide the right solution to fit your project.

Outside of my work, you can find me playing Magic The Gathering, visiting the movies or going to Rock/Pop-Punk Gigs.
