Hello, My name is Jack Whiting.

I am a product designer and developer based in Nottingham, United Kingdom. I take pride in building custom solutions which solve a companies problem. The majority of my time is spent between agency work, freelancing and side projects.

As a developer, I pride myself on building websites which function well, have great design, simplicity and speed. I play with WordPress, Laravel and Shopify to build easily accesible websites.
