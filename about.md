Hello, my name is Jack Whiting, a 24-year-old Product and Web Designer. Currently based in Nottingham, United Kingdom. I work for Adtrak but I am also available for freelance work.

I take pride in building custom solutions which solve an individual or companies problem. The majority of my time is spent between agency work, freelancing and side projects. I pride myself on building websites which function well, have great design, simplicity and speed. I use WordPress, Laravel and Shopify to build easily accessible websites.
