Hello, my name is Jack Whiting, a 25-year-old Web Designer & Developer. Currently based in Nottingham, United Kingdom. I am <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact" title="Contact Me for Work">available for freelance consultancy</a> on Websites & Web Applications.

I take pride in building custom solutions which solve real world problems. The majority of my time is spent between agency work, freelancing and side projects. I build websites and applications which function, have great design, and provide simplicity and speed to the user. I use WordPress, Laravel and Shopify to provide the right solution for your project.
