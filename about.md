Hello, my name is Jack Whiting. 

I am a product and web designer based in Nottingham, United Kingdom. I take pride in building custom solutions which solve an individual or companies problem. The majority of my time is spent between agency work, freelancing and side projects. 

I pride myself on building websites which function well, have great design, simplicity and speed. I use WordPress, Laravel and Shopify, usually, to build easily accessible websites.
