One of my first projects at Adtrak was to create a one page promotional website for the Rising Star Programme ran by Kruger Cowne. The promotion was to find one person from across the world to send into space.

The page was mainly used to provide information about the competiton, what was required of the winner in training, the timeline and process. Alongside the information I built a form which allowed applicants to submit themselves. This collected an array of data from the user and allowed Kruger Cowne to see all the entries in an admin panel.

Once the competition had ended the site automatically stopped new entries from being added and allowed Kruger to create a shortlist.

The site was a huge success for Kruger Cowne.
