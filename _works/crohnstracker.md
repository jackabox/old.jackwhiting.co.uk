Crohn's Tracker started as a passion project for myself and later became my dissertation project. 

Living with Crohn's Disease can be hard and at times taxing. I wanted to create a community which would be able to help each other. I built Crohn's Tracker to help a single user manage their symptoms, food eaten, medication and appointments. They could also connect with other users.

I build the project on a combination of [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) as an API. This allowed me to provide real-time interactions with the server.

I never got round to actually putting this life as the work to maintain it became too much, but it was fun as a side project.
