Crohn's Tracker started as a passion project for myself and later became my final dissertation project. 

Living with Crohn's Disease can be hard and at times taxing. I wanted to create a community which would be able to help each other. The app allowed a user to track their symptoms, food eaten, medication and appointments. They could also connect with others who shared similar issues.

I built the project on a combination of [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) as an API. This allowed me to provide real-time interactions with the server.

Although this was never released publically it was fun as a side project.
