Hole Hearted were looking to move from their Big Cartel platform and provide a more professional image with a new site. They wanted their new site to promote the products at the forefront and show their character and soul. 

The site was built on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and [WooCommerce](http://woocommerce.com). They were chosen to remove as much expense from the site as possible for the client. 

The main focus of the site was the products and how their customers loved them. Big promotional images were put on the home page, a lookbook section was created to show location shoots, and the client got some proffesional studio shoots so that the images were consistant and of a high standard to really push the brand.

Overall the client has seen an increase in sales and with some SEO work will see more increases later down the line.
