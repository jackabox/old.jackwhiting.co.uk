[PHPUnit Pretty Result Printer](https://github.com/mikeerickson/phpunit-pretty-result-printer) is a beautiful little extension for PHPUnit that cleans up and organises the output of tests. I'd highly recommend this for anyone using PHPUnit. 

For installation instructions visit the official repository [https://github.com/mikeerickson/phpunit-pretty-result-printer](https://github.com/mikeerickson/phpunit-pretty-result-printer).
