Over the past few weeks, I've finally got around to working with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) again. The last time I used the framework was when it was at version 4, this was when I was working with a team in Canada on [Pancake App](pancakeapp.com). 

The majority of my time these days is spent working on Wordpress sites and plugins such as; [Raw Halo](https://rawhalo.com). (A commerce store built on WooCommerce) and the [Skip Hire Plugin](skips.adtrakdev.com) to allow skip companies to purchase skips from their website.

Finally, we got in some projects which are bespoke so they require the use of Laravel. It feels such a relief and a breath of fresh air to pick it back up again and start working on some projects which don't fit the usual remit of work done within my agency. 

I've currently got a few big projects lined up including custom product configurators and a comparison of quotations, which I'll hopefully get some previews of later!

It feels great having the freedom to mold applications to my requirements along with an amazing community of support. 

Woo, Laravel.
